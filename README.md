Soku Archive Reorganization Utility

This program was created to fill a need for my friend Soku, thus it is named after him. 
All this script does is collapse all files from subdirectories into one folder, with all files renamed after their original
parent folder. A directory can be passed as an argument, otheriwse the current directory will be used.
